# ImageQuery

ImageQuery (name due for change) is a simple python based
interface that easily allows for looking at random images
over multiple directories and the ability to with the press of a
button delete or (to come) move the images.

As once logical directory structures can easily become daunting to look 
through after some time and files can get drowned in thousands
of others, I have always felt the need to just *randomly* clean
things up. ImageQuery tries to fill this gap by making it really
easy to do this over time, compared to the standard linear method of 
needing to keep track of progress while going through tens to hundreds
of filled directories. The nature of randomness should make it effective
while not needing to keep track of progress, or forcing oneself to
finish a task at ones.

ImageQuery provides blacklisting, patternmatching for 
additional information and customizable hotkeys for all repetitive
processes involved.
